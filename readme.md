# SA2 Hunting Training Mod
Companion mod for Sonic Adventure 2 that restricts set RNG as specified

## Requirements: 

Install the hunter tourney mod by Prahaha + IDGeek through the SA2 mod manager [(download here)](https://github.com/Ngolinvaux/HunterTourney/releases/tag/v1.1.1)

## Instructions:

Provide in sets.txt (in the executable directory) a group of set IDs from a 1024 sheet of your choice, each ID separated by a new line.  You can copy+paste from the leftmost column of the 1024 sheet from this google drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RW00L3s5yO7mS6Cf8DkzT8poYZKVW4Fl) for ease of use.

Open the game with the tourney mod installed, then run the companion executable **in that order**.  Enter your preferred safe color even if you aren't doing Security Hall, and select whether or not you want to run with replacement (duplicates allowed) or no replacement (duplicates only after you see every set) and the companion will be active.

The provided sets.txt in the release gives you a few sets with "a golden circle on a red circle" as your first piece in wild canyon, but only on first load.
