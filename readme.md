# SA2 Hunting Training Mod
Companion mod for Sonic Adventure 2 that restricts set RNG as specified

##Requirements: 

Install the hunter tourney mod by Prahaha through the SA2 mod manager [(download here)](https://github.com/Ngolinvaux/HunterTourney/releases/tag/v1.1.1)

##Instructions:

Provide in sets.txt (in the executable directory) a group of set IDs from a 1024 sheet of your choice, each ID separated by a new line.  You can copy+paste from the leftmost column of the 1024 sheet from this google drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RW00L3s5yO7mS6Cf8DkzT8poYZKVW4Fl) for ease of use.

Open the game with the tourney mod installed, then run the companion executable **in that order**.  Enter your preferred safe color even if you aren't doing Security Hall, and the companion will be active.

The provided sets.txt in the release gives you 4 different "a box surrounded by lights" sets in Mad Space, use that to test the mod.
